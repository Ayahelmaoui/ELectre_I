# Electre1-D Java Program
The Electre1-D Java Program is designed to facilitate Electre I decision analysis. It allows you to input data, perform concordance and discordance analyses, and make project selections based on predefined thresholds.

# Features
Concordance and Discordance Analysis: Calculate concordance and discordance matrices for your data.
Project Selection: Determine which projects meet specified concordance and discordance thresholds.
Data Input: Read data from CSV files or manually enter data.
#Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
# Usage
Open Existing Data:

Perform Analysis:

Click the "Traitement" button to calculate the concordance and discordance matrices.
Adjust the c and d thresholds as needed.
View Results:

A tabbed interface will display the concordance, discordance, and selection matrices.
Click the "Affichage" button to view the selected projects.
#Save Data (Optional):
