# Electre1-D Java Program
The Electre1-D Java Program is designed to facilitate Electre I decision analysis. It allows you to input data, perform concordance and discordance analyses, and make project selections based on predefined thresholds.

# Features
Concordance and Discordance Analysis: Calculate concordance and discordance matrices for your data.
Project Selection: Determine which projects meet specified concordance and discordance thresholds.
Data Input: Read data from CSV files or manually enter data.
#Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
# Usage
1. Open Existing Data:

Click the "Ouvrir" button to open an existing CSV file containing your data.
The CSV file should contain project data, with criteria represented as columns and projects as rows.

2. Enter New Data (Optional):

Click the "Nouveau" button to manually enter new project data.
Enter the performance data for each project and criterion in the provided table.
Specify the weight of each criterion and the thresholds for c and d.

3. Perform Analysis:

Click the "Traitement" button to calculate the concordance and discordance matrices.
Adjust the c and d thresholds as needed.

4. View Results:

A tabbed interface will display the concordance, discordance, and selection matrices.
Click the "Affichage" button to view the selected projects.

5. Save Data (Optional):

Click the "Enregistrer" button to save your data and configuration to a text file for future use.

6. Quit:

Click the "Quitter" button to exit the program.
# Sample Data
The program comes with sample data for demonstration purposes. You can either use the sample data or replace it with your own.

We welcome contributions and improvements to the Electre1-D Java Program. If you have expertise in Java graphics and visualization or you have ideas on how to make the `NodeGraph` class work effectively, we encourage you to contribute to this project.

### About the NodeGraph Class

The `NodeGraph` class is intended to visualize the results of the Electre I analysis by creating a node graph representation. However, it currently requires further development and improvement to function optimally.

### How You Can Contribute

- **Code Enhancement**: You can work on improving the `NodeGraph` class, fixing issues, and optimizing its performance.

- **Bug Fixes**: If you encounter any bugs or issues with the `NodeGraph` class, please report them, or better yet, submit a pull request with fixes.

- **Documentation**: Enhance the documentation of the `NodeGraph` class to make it easier for others to understand and use.

- **Ideas and Suggestions**: If you have ideas or suggestions for how to enhance the visual representation of Electre I results, please share them.
